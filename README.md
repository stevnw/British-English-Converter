# British-English-Converter
Firefox extension that Replaces American English spellings with British English


Current bugs:
- Sometimes it won't let me untoggle, which seems to be site dependant. (Why would one want to untoggle?)
- Seems to work on Chromium but I don't really intend to use it on Chrome anyway...
